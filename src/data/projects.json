    "longDescription": "ProductImporterPro is a full-stack system for importing large product catalogs from CSV files without blocking API requests. The React + TypeScript frontend uploads CSVs and subscribes to live progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE). The FastAPI backend creates an UploadTask record in PostgreSQL, stores the raw CSV bytes temporarily in Redis with a TTL, and enqueues a Celery task into RabbitMQ. Celery workers consume tasks from RabbitMQ, retrieve the CSV from Redis, parse and validate rows, deduplicate by SKU, and perform high-throughput bulk upserts into PostgreSQL using ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE. Throughout processing, the worker writes progress snapshots back to Redis, which FastAPI streams to the UI. Webhook configurations are stored in PostgreSQL and triggered asynchronously after successful imports.",
